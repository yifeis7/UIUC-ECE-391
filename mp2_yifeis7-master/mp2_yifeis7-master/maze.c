 * the index of this point is 2 X_DIM + (2 Y_DIM + 2) * 2 X_DIM, or
 * 2 X_DIM (2 Y_DIM + 3), and the space allocated is one larger than this

 * make_maze
 *   DESCRIPTION: Create a maze of specified dimensions.  The maze is
 *                built as a two-dimensional lattice in which the points
 *       01234      with odd indices in both dimensions are always open,
 *     0 -----      those with even indices in both dimensions are always
 *     1 - ? -      walls, and other points are either open or walls to form
 *     2 -?*?-      the maze.  The maze to the left is a 2x2 example.  The 
 *     3 - ? -      spaces are the four (odd,odd) lattice points.  The 
 *     4 -----      boundary is marked with minus signs (these are always 
 *            walls).  The one (even,even) lattice point--also always 
 *            a wall--is marked with an asterisk.  Finally, the
 *            four question marks may or may not be walls; these 
 *            four options are used to create different mazes.
 *
 *                The algorithm used consists of two phases.  In the first
 *                phase, metaphorical worms are dropped into the maze and 
 *                allowed to wander about randomly, digging out the maze, 
 *                until they decide to stop.  More worms are added until
 *                all of the (odd,odd) points have been cleared.  Each worm
 *              starts on an (odd,odd) point still marked as a wall.
 *
 *                Once the worms have done their work, the second phase
 *                of the algorithm begins.  This phase ensures that a path
 *                exists from any (odd,odd) lattice point to any other
 *                (odd,odd) point.  First, those points connected to the
 *                point (1,1) are marked as reachable.  Next, an unconnected
 *                point adjacent to a connected point is chosen at random,
 *                and the wall between them is removed, making another
 *                section of the maze reachable from (1,1).  This process
 *                continues until most of the maze is reachable or a
 *                certain number of attempts have been made, at which point
 *                we scan the maze for such adjacent pairs (rather than
 *                choosing randomly) until the entire maze is reachable
 *                from (1,1).
 *   INPUTS: (x_dim,y_dim) -- size of maze
 *           start_fruits -- number of fruits to place in maze
 *   OUTPUTS: none
 *   RETURN VALUE: 0 on success, -1 on failure (if requested maze size
 *              exceeds limits set by defined values, with minimum
 *              (MAZE_MIN_X_DIM,MAZE_MIN_Y_DIM) and maximum
 *              (MAZE_MAX_X_DIM,MAZE_MAX_Y_DIM))
