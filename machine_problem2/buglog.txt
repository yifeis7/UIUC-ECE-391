##Check point 1##

modex.c:
        Problem: The top line of pixels are not displayed
            correctly after I finished draw_vert_line
        Solution: I simply copied the draw_horiz_line and change x to y or change y to x wihtout
            knowing the mechanism. Later I changed the for loop at the end of function and make the 
            access to memory correct.(2022.2.24)

        Problem: The player went down into the status bar and disappear.
        Solution: Decrease the macro SCROLL_Y_DIM by 18 which is the height of the status bar.(2022.2.25)

        Problem: Two werid characters showed at the end of status bar
        Solution: Modify the text_to_image function and stop iterating when reaching the end of string.
            Use snprintf and pass the string a string buffer with fixed size.(2022.2.25)


mazegame.c
        Problem: The player can not move after entering the game
        Solution: Forget to comment the line 543 and 544 of mazegame.c and still use draw_full_block for displaying.
            (2022.2.26)

        Problem: The fruit does not disappear if the player stops above it.
        Solution: Move the block_mask, show_screen and block_undraw function out of the if judgement block and redraw even when the player 
            is static.

##Check point 2##
modex.cï¼š
        Problem: The player's head only shows one color after implementing player_glow
        Solution: I changed the color index method from using local variable to the tick and the color changes when
            tick is the multiple of 3.(2022.2.26)
        
        Problem: The color of the whole screen is totally unnormal
        Solution: I use a new palette which stores the original 64 colors and new 64 transparent colors, but I add 64 
            to the pelette index each time when I want to draw transparent pixel, and garbage data are read into the build 
            buffer. So I added a judgement to avoid repeated adding.(2022.3.4)

        Problem: The transparent text have trails
        Solution: I forget to clear the transparent texts. The bug was fixxed after I add clear_transparent_text function.(2022.3.4)
mazegame.c
        Problem: The devel machine jumps(crashes) to the log in state whenever I run it.
        Solution: I used the same "fd" for both tux and keyboard, and I added fd_tux.(2022.3.5)

        Problem: The program freezes when quitting
        Solution: I changed from pthread_join to pthread_cancel for the third thread.(2022.3.5)

        Problem: The button of tux does not work.
        Solution: I use wrong format for the bit vector of button. I changed the judging condition from active low to active high and it works. (2022.3.5)
module  
        Problem: The button of tux does not work.
        Solution: I use wrong format for the bit vector of button. I changed the bit vector output from active low to active high and it works. (2022.3.5)

        Problem: There are no dots on tux led.
        Solution: I forgot to deal with them in the tux_set_led function. After adding, it works.(2022.3.5)
